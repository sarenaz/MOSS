MOSS is open, evolving, and always in progress. It aims to build an educational platform for Social Science researchers to communicate, collaborate and learn together about [Open Scholarship](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/open/open-scholarship.html?highlight=open%20scholarship) principles, practices, and products in multiple languages. 

The ultimate aim of the MOSS is to make the global science open and inclusive of the marginalised knowledges lived and generated by researchers from the Global South, with a particular focus on Central Asia (CA).

## Phases of Development 

- **Phase one**: 
   
  - [ ] Create an open database with basic resources on Open Scholarship 

- **Phase two**: 

  - [ ] Categorise the collected resources according to types/topics/relevance 

- **Phase three**: 

  - [ ] Invite contributors - translators, open science experts, digital social science researchers, tech developers 

- **Phase four**:

  - [ ] Develop an open, evolving educational platform (or Jupyter Book) with Open Scholarhip resources 
 
# Contributing 
  
MOSS welcomes contributions from anyone! If you are passionate about making science just, equitable, diverse, and inclusive, please feel free to reach out to us. 

At this stage, MOSS needs volunteers with the knowledge of Central Asian languages and tech developers who could help with the initiation and launch of the online multilingual educational platform.
