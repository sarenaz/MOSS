# Multilingual Open Science Space (MOSS)

 *Who, then, will write the history of the bottom, the history of the moss?*
 
 ~ M. Darwish 

*Knowing the mosses enriches our knowing of the world*

~ R. W. Kimmer 

          
**MOSS** is open, evolving, and always in progress. It aims to build an educational platform for social science researchers to communicate, collaborate and learn together about [Open Scholarship](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/open/open-scholarship.html?highlight=open%20scholarship) principles, practices, and products in multiple Cetrnal Asian languages. 

The ultimate aim of the MOSS is to make the global science open to and inclusive of the marginalised knowledges lived and generated by researchers from the Global South, with a particular focus on Central Asia (CA).

 
# Contributing 
  
MOSS welcomes contributions from anyone! If you are passionate about making science just, equitable, diverse, and inclusive, please feel free to reach out to us. 

At this stage, MOSS needs volunteers with the knowledge of Central Asian languages and tech developers who could help with the initiation and launch of the online multilingual educational platform.
