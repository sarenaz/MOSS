# Multilingual Open Science Space

MOSS is open, evolving, and always in progress. It aims to build an educational platform for Social Science and Humanities researchers to communicate, collaborate and learn together about Open Science and FAIR research principles, practices, and products in multiple languages. 

# Purpose 

The ultimate aim of the MOSS is to make science open to knowledges of variously marginalised people living and working from the Global South.
