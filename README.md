# Multilingual Open Science Space

MOSS is open, evolving, and always in progress. It aims to build an educational platform for Social Science and Humanities researchers to communicate, collaborate and learn together about [Open Research](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/open.html) principles, practices, and products in multiple languages. 

The ultimate aim of the MOSS is to make the global science and research open and inclusive of the marginalised knowledges lived and generated by researchers from the Global South, with a particular focus on Central Asia (CA).

## Stages of Development 

- Stage one: 
   
  Create an open database with basic and contextually relevant resources on Open Research 

- Stage two: 

  Categorise the collected resources according to types/topics/relevance 

- Stage three 

  Invite contributors - translators, open science experts, digital social science researchers, tech developers 

- Stage four 

  Develop an open, evolving, incomplete educational platform with Open Research resources 
 
# Contribution 
  
MOSS welcomes contributions from anyone! If you are passionate about making science open, inclusive, and multilingual, please, feel free to reach out to us. 

At this stage, MOSS needs the volunteers with the knowledge of Central Asian languages and tech developers who could help with the initiation and launch of the online multilingual educational platform.
