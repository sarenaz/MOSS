# Multilingual Open Science Space

MOSS is an open, evolving, and always incomplete educational platform for researchers to communicate, collaborate and learn together about Open Science and FAIR research principles, practices, and products in multiple languages.

The ultimate aim of the MOSS is to deconstruct epistemic and linguistic barriers existing in the global knowledge production arena, thus opening science and research to variously marginalised groups of people and their ways of being, knowing, and relating.
