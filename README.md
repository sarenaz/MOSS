# Multilingual Open Science Space

MOSS is open, evolving, and always in progress. It aims to build an educational platform for Social Science and Humanities researchers to communicate, collaborate and learn together about Open Science and FAIR research principles, practices, and products in multiple languages.

The ultimate aim of the MOSS is to open the global science and research to variously marginalised groups of researchers and their ways of being, knowing, and relating.
